- Tonality is a single underlying power, or musical foundation, that has guided composers to create forward-moving and dramatic music.
- Tension in tonal music seeks resolution.
- The desire for resolution in tonality can be used to create propulsion and drama.
- The tonic can be described as the pitch to which others are drawn

	perfect pitch into three parts: 
	
	1. Develop relative pitch
	2. Internalize a reference note
	3. Practice to reduce computation time.
