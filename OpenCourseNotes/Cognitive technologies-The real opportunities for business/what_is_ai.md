## What is AI

AI is not machines that think. Is about what machines **do**, not how they do it.

Definition: The theory and develpment of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.

Cognitive tasks: planning, reasoning, learning

Perceptual tasks:speech recognition, understanding text, facial recognition

AI agents: operate autonomously, perceive their evironment, persist over time, adapt to change, create and pursue goals

### short history

1940s-1950s：用电脑模拟大脑运作，Alan Turing，John Mccarthy（ai 一词发明者），Alan Newell, Herbert Simon

1960s-1970s：Demonstration programs，遇到众多障碍后，60s 中期热潮退去

1980s：AI boost 因为日本 The fifth generation project 的威胁，美国在80年代对 AI 进行了新的投入。
Expert systems问题：
- lack of common sense
- hard to express tacit knowledge as rules
- expensive and difficult to build

1990s:neural networks, genetic algorithms

2000s

## Catalysts of progress

Moore's law: 计算机性能每18个月翻倍

Big data: Internet, social media, mobile devices, low cost sensors

The Internet and cloud computing: 
1.data available via any internet-connected device
2.people can collaborate

Algorithms(procedure for performing a task) & open source movement
