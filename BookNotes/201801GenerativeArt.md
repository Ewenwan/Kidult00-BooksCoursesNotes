# Generative Art
Three organic processes taught to us by the natural world: emergence, autonomy, and fractals.

Generative art is about the organic, the emergent, the beautiful, the imprecise, and the unexpected.

Generative art is about having fun with coding. Programming isn’t just about good practice, structure, and efficiency; it can be about freedom, creativity, and expression, too.

## Introduction: the organic vs. the mechanical

> Things which grow shape themselves from within outwards—they are not assemblages of originally distinct parts; they partition themselves, elaborating their own structure frome the whole to the parts, from the simple to the complex.

Programming is an interface between man and machine; it’s a clean, logical discipline, with clearly defined aims. Art is an emotional subject, highly subjective and defying definition. 

Generative art is the discipline of taking strict, cold, logical processes and subverting them into creating illogical, unpredictable, and expressive results.

**Generative art is about creating the organic using the mechanical.**

With generative art most of the skill doesn’t have to be learned; it’s already encapsulated within the tools.

### Order and Chaos

The generative artist comes from the world of logic to look toward the natural world for inspiration.

Order and chaos, simplicity and complexity, the mechanical and the organic, aren’t necessarily at opposite ends of a spectrum. They’re symbiotic, intertwined. Any line we might walk between the two is a knife edge.

No matter how much order you impose upon your life, chaos is never more than a car crash away.

To eradicate chaos is to become a robot; to eradicate order is to become a savage. We can attempt to use the mechanical to create the organic, starting from order and heading toward chaos, careful not to stray too far in one direction or the other.

### Ch1. Generative Art: In Theory and Practice

> “Generative art refers to any art practice where the artist uses a system, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art.” 
> 
> -- Philip Galanter, artist and professor at Texas A&M University, from his 2003 paper “What Is Generative Art? Complexity Theory as a Context for Art Theory”

GenArt is just another byproduct of the eternal titanic battle between the forces of chaos and order trying to work out their natural harmony, as expressed in a ballet of light and pixels.

The artist creates ground rules and formulae, usually including random or semi- random elements, and then kicks off an autonomous process to create the artwork.there must be a degree of unpredictability.

generative methods may also be used to produce music, architecture, poetry, dance, storytelling or interactive experiences, and the autonomous systems behind their creation may also be mechanical, games of chance, natural phenomena, or subconscious human behavior.

**The real tools of GenArt, the underlying constants to the various tools you can use, are the algorithms**

Generative art is:

* An algorithmic way of creating an aesthetic
* A collaboration between an artist and an autonomous system
* An exercise in extracting unpredictable results from perfectly deterministic processes
*  A quest for that sweet spot between order and chaos
* A fresh, fun approach to coding
* A growing medium with huge potential
