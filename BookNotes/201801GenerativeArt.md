# Generative Art
Three organic processes taught to us by the natural world: emergence, autonomy, and fractals.

Generative art is about the organic, the emergent, the beautiful, the imprecise, and the unexpected.

Generative art is about having fun with coding. Programming isn’t just about good practice, structure, and efficiency; it can be about freedom, creativity, and expression, too.

## Introduction: the organic vs. the mechanical

> Things which grow shape themselves from within outwards—they are not assemblages of originally distinct parts; they partition themselves, elaborating their own structure frome the whole to the parts, from the simple to the complex.

Programming is an interface between man and machine; it’s a clean, logical discipline, with clearly defined aims. Art is an emotional subject, highly subjective and defying definition. 

Generative art is the discipline of taking strict, cold, logical processes and subverting them into creating illogical, unpredictable, and expressive results.

**Generative art is about creating the organic using the mechanical.**

With generative art most of the skill doesn’t have to be learned; it’s already encapsulated within the tools.
