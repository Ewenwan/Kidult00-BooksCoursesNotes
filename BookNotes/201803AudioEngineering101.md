# Audio Engineering 101 - A Beginner's Guide to Music Production

Sound is a vibration or a series of vibrations that move through the air.

### Seven Characteristics of Sound

#### Amplitude 振幅

the height of a sound wave

单位是 decibels(dB)。大多数人能识别 3dB 的振幅变化。增大振幅：boost，减小振幅：cut

- 0 dB: near slience
- 40-50 dB: room ambience
- 50-60 dB: whisper
- 60-75 dB: typical conversation
- 80-85 dB: a blender, optimum level to monitor sound according to the Fletcher-Munson curve
- 90 dB: factory noise, regular exposure can cause hearing damage
- 100 dB: baby crying
- 110 dB: leaf blower, car horn
- 120 dB: threshold of pain, can cause hearing damage
- 140 dB: snare drum played hard from about 1'
- 150-160 dB: jet engine

音量 volume 经常用来代替振幅

#### Frequency 频率

The amount of cycles per second (cps) created by a sound wave. Frequency is related to the pitch of a sound.

A / 440 hertz (Hz)

人的听力范围： 20 ~ 20000 Hz

- Low/bass: 20~200 Hz
- Mid: 200~5k Hz, the range within which we hear the best.
	+ Low-mids: 200~700 Hz darker, hollow tones
	+ Mid-mids: 700~2k Hz more aggressive "live" tones
	+ High-mids: 2~5 kHz brighter, present tones
- High/treble: 5~20k Hz

#### Phase 相位

Phase designates a point in a sound wave's cycle and is also related to frequency.

单位 degree

当两个声波 in phase，会增强振幅；当两个声波 180° out of phase，会完全抵消。这一原理运用在降噪耳机、消音器上。

#### Velocity

Sound travels about 1130 ft per second at 68°F or 344 m/s at 20°C

速度取决于温度

#### Wavelength
频率低波长更长

#### Harmonics 和声
timbre 音色

#### Envelope 包络

ADSR

- attack: the area that rises from silence to its peak volume
- decay: the area goes from the peak to a medium level of decline
- sustain: the portion of the envelope that is constant in the declining stage
- release: last point in the envelope where the sound returns back to silence
