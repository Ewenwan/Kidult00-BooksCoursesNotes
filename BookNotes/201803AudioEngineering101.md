## Ch1 What is Sound

Sound is a vibration or a series of vibrations that move through the air.

### Seven Characteristics of Sound

#### Amplitude 振幅

the height of a sound wave

单位是 decibels(dB)。大多数人能识别 3dB 的振幅变化。增大振幅：boost，减小振幅：cut

- 0 dB: near slience
- 40-50 dB: room ambience
- 50-60 dB: whisper
- 60-75 dB: typical conversation
- 80-85 dB: a blender, optimum level to monitor sound according to the Fletcher-Munson curve
- 90 dB: factory noise, regular exposure can cause hearing damage
- 100 dB: baby crying
- 110 dB: leaf blower, car horn
- 120 dB: threshold of pain, can cause hearing damage
- 140 dB: snare drum played hard from about 1'
- 150-160 dB: jet engine

音量 volume 经常用来代替振幅

#### Frequency 频率

The amount of cycles per second (cps) created by a sound wave. Frequency is related to the pitch of a sound.

A / 440 hertz (Hz)

人的听力范围： 20 ~ 20000 Hz

- Low/bass: 20~200 Hz
- Mid: 200~5k Hz, the range within which we hear the best.
	+ Low-mids: 200~700 Hz darker, hollow tones
	+ Mid-mids: 700~2k Hz more aggressive "live" tones
	+ High-mids: 2~5 kHz brighter, present tones
- High/treble: 5~20k Hz

#### Phase 相位

Phase designates a point in a sound wave's cycle and is also related to frequency.

单位 degree

当两个声波 in phase，会增强振幅；当两个声波 180° out of phase，会完全抵消。这一原理运用在降噪耳机、消音器上。

#### Velocity

Sound travels about 1130 ft per second at 68°F or 344 m/s at 20°C

速度取决于温度

#### Wavelength
频率低波长更长

#### Harmonics 和声

#### Envelope 包络

ADSR

- attack: the area that rises from silence to its peak volume
- decay: the area goes from the peak to a medium level of decline
- sustain: the portion of the envelope that is constant in the declining stage
- release: last point in the envelope where the sound returns back to silence

### Noise
S/N signal-to-noise ratio

## Ch2 How to Listen

[Fletcher–Munson curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fletcher%E2%80%93Munson_curves)

人耳对 3.5 KHz 左右的声音最敏感，如吉他声。对 1~5 KHz 范围声音敏感，那也是人声的范围。

90 dB 声音在不同频率段都较平缓。

Around 95 dB, the ear's natural defense is to limit the volume of the sound.

To ensure the mix is not bass heavy or bass light, monitor sound between 80 and 85 dB.

Sound can be divided into three successively occurring categories that arrive at the ears in the following order: direct path, early reflections, and reverberation 混响.

### Ear Training Tools and Techniques

#### 3D Ball

[3D Reference Ball (Video 1) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOCfaNOABUo)

- front and back: controlled by volume, EQ, and reverb
- left and right: controlled by panning
- top and bottom: controlled by EQ

#### Frequency Pyramid

The pyramid would be built with low frequencies on the bottom, mid frequencies in the middle, and high frequencies on the top. If the pyramid is lacking a particular frequency range, the mix may sound unbalanced or incomplete.

#### Selevtive Hearing

- practice focusing on an individual instrument for the entire song
- try to follow every note or beat
- repeat this for each instrument or sound in the mix
- listen to like instruments, exp bass and kick drum or two electric guitars. Examine their ralationship in the mix
- focus on groups of instruments, such as strings, vocals, and rhythm tracks. What are the overall relationships in the mix?

#### Analyzing Music Recordings

1. listen to a song and indentify all the instruments or sounds in the mix
2. where are all the sound s placed in the 3D reference ball? Which sounds appear in the center? Which sounds appear on the sides? Do any instruments have a sterreo spread?
3. how do the vocals sit in the mix? Are they in the front of the ball or do they belnd more with the music?
4. what are the tones of the individual sounds? Are some sound bright while others are dark or dull? What is the overall tone of the recording?
5. can you hear the environment around each sound? Do all the instruments appear to be in the same space? What does the overall environment sound like?
6. Is it a "wet" mix or a  "dry" mix? A wet mix weill have a lot of effects, such as reverb, delay, or echo, and is often used in pop, psychedelic 迷幻, surf, and reggae music. A dry mix will be more organic with little or no effects apparent in the mix. Dry mixes are more common to folk, blues, jazz, classical, adn bluegrass music.
7. Finally, and most importantly, how does the recording make you feel?

It is always good to establish some type of reference point between two different instruments or mixes.

## Ch 3 EQ Points of Interest

Equalization or EQ, can be used to describe the action of equalizing a sound, a control to change the tone, or a reference to the tone of a sound.

Low-cut or High-pass Filters

Subtractive equalization is a technique used to create clearer, more defined mixes.

Ultimatedly, mixing is about "crowd control".
